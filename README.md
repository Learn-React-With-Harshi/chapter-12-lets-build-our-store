## Class Summary `Chapter-11 Data is the new oil` (29/01/2023)
   
  In this weekend (chpater-10 & chapter-11), we will be covering the two important layers of any Single Page Application - UI layer & Data layer. Chapter-11 is about Data layer of the app. Consider data as if it's oil, use it wisely because that is what powers the engine, and its expensive as well. There were discussion on what is data in React, how to pass data in the component hierarchy, from parent to child, child to siblings, child to parent, and finally throughout the app.

  Find my version of detailed explanation of these concepts in [theory-assignment.md](https://github.com/Learn-React-With-Harshi/chapter-11-data-is-the-new-oil/blob/main/theory-assignment.md). Check [coding-assignment.md](https://github.com/Learn-React-With-Harshi/chapter-11-data-is-the-new-oil/blob/main/coding-assignment.md) for all the features that I implemented in this chapter.

One line about this chapter : `If you want to : 1) pass props from parent to child, grandchild(2 levels), use Props Drilling, 2) pass props from child to parent or its siblings use Lifting State Up and 3) make data available throughout the app, then use Context Provider`
